# push_swap

This program sorts data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. <br>
For that, various types of algorithms have been manipulated and the most appropriate solution has been choosen for an optimized data sorting - based on the "Longest Increasing Subsequence".<br> <br>

There are 2 stacks named a and b. At the beginning the stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated. The stack b is empty. The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. Certain operations are available for this purpose.

## How to run the code
* In your terminal run: ```make```
* Run the code with: ```./push_swap [numbers in random order]```
